## Objective :

Face recognition is a powerful technology used in various applications. This project will guide you through developing and deploying a face recognition web app using machine learning and Flask. The project will cover everything from image processing to creating a web server gateway interface.

## Project Outline :

1. **Image Processing with OpenCV**
2. **Image Data Preprocessing**
3. **Image Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Eigenfaces with PCA**
5. **Face Recognition Classification Model with Support Vector Machines**
6. **Pipeline Model**
7. **Flask (Jinja Template, HTML, CSS, HTTP Methods)**

Finally, we will integrate all these components to build a fully functional face recognition web app.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-web-app.git
cd FaceRecognition-GenderApp-Flask
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the app in action.
